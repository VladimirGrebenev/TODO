# TODO
the project
"Web service for working with TODO notes".
Here is an approximate description of the work of the entire site.
There will be 3 categories of users on the site: administrators, project managers and developers.
The site allows you to work with TODO notes that relate to any project. You can
add a project to the site and then save notes on it containing text and status. One
project is handled by a team of developers and managers.
